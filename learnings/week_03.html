            <h2>The 7-Stage Cycle of Action</h2>
            <p>
                According to <strong>Donald Norman (1988)</strong>, we don't just "use" a computer; we go through a cycle to reach a goal. I learned that every interaction can be broken down into these steps:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Goal:</strong> What I want (e.g., "I want to turn on Wi-Fi").</li>
                <li><strong>Plan:</strong> Deciding how to do it.</li>
                <li><strong>Specify:</strong> Which buttons do I need to click?</li>
                <li><strong>Execute:</strong> Actually clicking them.</li>
                <li><strong>Perceive:</strong> Seeing what happened on the screen.</li>
                <li><strong>Interpret:</strong> Understanding the change (e.g., "The icon turned blue").</li>
                <li><strong>Evaluate:</strong> Did I get what I wanted?</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>The "Gulfs" that Break UX</h2>
            <p>
                My favorite part of this week was learning about the two "Gulfs." If a user gets stuck, it's usually because of one of these:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Gulf of Execution:</strong> The user knows what they want, but the UI makes it impossible to figure out <em>how</em> to do it.</li>
                <li><strong>Gulf of Evaluation:</strong> The user did something, but the system didn't give clear feedback, so they don't know if it worked.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Safety Critical Systems: The Syringe Example</h2>
            <p>
                In the **Dix book (Chapter 3)**, there is a scary example about an automatic syringe. If the interface is confusing, a nurse might accidentally double-click and cause a 10x overdose. This taught me that HCI isn't just about "cool apps"—it's literally a matter of life and death in some fields.
