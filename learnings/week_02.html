            <h2>The Three-Stage Processing Theory</h2>
            <p>
                This week was a deep dive into the <strong>Information Processing Theory</strong>. I learned that humans don't just "see" a button; we process it in stages. According to the lecture (Slide 29), it looks like this:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Sensory Memory:</strong> Our eyes grab a snapshot of the UI (very brief!).</li>
                <li><strong>Short-Term Memory (Working Memory):</strong> We hold the info while we decide what to do (limited capacity).</li>
                <li><strong>Long-Term Memory:</strong> Where we store things like "Red usually means delete" or "The 'X' is always in the corner."</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Mental Models: Why Users Get Confused</h2>
            <p>
                A huge takeaway for me was the concept of <strong>Mental Models</strong>. A mental model is the user's internal map of how they *think* a system works. 
            </p>
            <p>
                If the designer's "System Image" doesn't match the user's "Mental Model," the user gets frustrated. For example, if a user thinks a "Save" button works automatically but the system requires manual clicking, that's a model mismatch.

            <h2>Key Theories Table</h2>
            <p>We looked at several big names in HCI history this week. Here is my summary of the most important ones from the lecture slides:</p>

            <h2>My Reflection</h2>
            <p>
                Seeing the "Young Lady vs. Old Lady" illusion in class (Slide 3) really proved how much <strong>Perception</strong> matters. Two people can look at the same UI and see totally different things based on their attention and mental state.
