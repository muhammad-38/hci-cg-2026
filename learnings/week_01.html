            <h2>First Impressions</h2>
            <p>
                In our first week, I realized HCI is much bigger than just "making pretty screens." It’s actually a mix of psychology, computer science, and even sociology. One thing that stuck with me is that we don't just "use" computers; we interact with them as agents.

            <h2>The "Aha!" Moment: Miller's Law</h2>
            <p>
                I used to think that every menu should only have 7 items because of "Miller's Law." But according to <strong>Dix et al. (p. 29)</strong>, this is a total myth in UI design! 
            </p>
            <p>
                Miller's Law is about <em>Working Memory</em>—the stuff we have to hold in our heads. Since a menu is right there on the screen, we can <strong>recognize</strong> it rather than having to <strong>recall</strong> it. So, you don't have to limit your menus to 7 items!

            <h2>How the "Human Processor" Works</h2>
            <p>
                We looked at how humans are like computers in a way. We have:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sensory Input:</strong> Seeing the screen or hearing a notification.</li>
                <li><strong>Processing:</strong> Thinking about what to click (Cognitive Processor).</li>
                <li><strong>Output:</strong> Moving the mouse or tapping the screen (Motor Processor).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This "Sense-Decide-Act" loop is the heart of every interaction we design.
