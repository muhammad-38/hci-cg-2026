            <h2>GOMS: The "Expert" Model</h2>
            <p>
                Last week, Norman's model was about how users think and feel. This week, <strong>GOMS (Goals, Operators, Methods, Selection Rules)</strong> showed me a different side of HCI. It treats the user like a professional who already knows the system. 
            </p>
            <p>
                As we discussed in the <strong>Toggle Switch Interaction</strong> example (Slide 1), GOMS breaks down a simple "Turn on Wi-Fi" task into the specific logic an expert uses to choose the fastest route.

            <h2>KLM: The Stopwatch of HCI</h2>
            <p>
                The <strong>Keystroke-Level Model (KLM)</strong> is like a stopwatch. By using the operators from <strong>Dix et al. (p. 437)</strong>, we can predict task time.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>K (Keystroke):</strong> ~0.2s</li>
                <li><strong>P (Pointing):</strong> ~1.1s</li>
                <li><strong>H (Homing):</strong> ~0.4s (Moving hand from mouse to keys)</li>
                <li><strong>M (Mental Preparation):</strong> ~1.35s (The "thinking" pause)</li>

            <h2>My Takeaway: Who Paid?</h2>
            <p>
                The "Who Paid" problem from our lab assignment (Slide 6) showed why we need these models. When a bill is split, the **Cognitive Load** is huge because users have to rely on **Recall**. By using KLM, we can see that a manual calculation takes way longer than a well-designed UI "toggle" because of all the 'M' (Mental) operators involved.
